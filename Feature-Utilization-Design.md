# Feature Utilization Design

## Data Source

### Current and Target Source

Data | Current | Target
- | - | -
Build raw data | Event Hub | Event Hub
Warning/Error log | Blob | Simplified in Event Hub;<br> Or still Complete in Blob
Build event configuration | None | Event Hub or Blob
Docfx log | Application Insights | Application Insights or Event Hub

### Other Source (Used for Demo now)

+ Builder exposing API: Get build event configuration
+ Github API: Sync previous configuration

## Data Storage

Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)

+ Fast and permanent
+ Support Structured, Semi-Sturctured and Unstructured data (everything in one database)
+ Design for large volumes of logs and data OLAP from streaming sources(build-in support ingesting from Event Hub).

## Current Workflow

![workflow](./Materials/Event-Hub-to-ADE-workflow2.png)

1. Using Event Hub and event-based Azure Function to achieve push mode (real-time view).

2. Blob Storage can be used if the size of the content will exceed of the limit of event (1 MB). (error log, configuration)

3. Azure Data Explorer update policy can be used to：
    + Exposing better view of data for users (if they need to read data directly from ADE)
    + Better integrate with the needs of powerBI (query speed, logical process)

4. Persist Docfx Application Insights Metrics data using Azure Data Factory (AI and Kusto data synchronization will be supported in the future).

5. Power BI directly queries data from Kusto.
    + Support real-time view
    + Using kusto powerful query

6. Power BI query.
    + Demo reports
    + The query is exposed to users
    (Note that many features are limited in directly query mode)

## Problems and Solutions

1. How to achieve low dependency?
Builder exposing API and Github API are minimized in the design.

2. How to make up for past data?
Github API can help to fetch previous configurations.
